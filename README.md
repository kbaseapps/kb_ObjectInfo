# kb_ObjectInfo

The purpose of this module is to provide downloadable output for data objects that don't have a viewer, landing page, and/or a download format of interest. All of the output will be in text format and available for download. 

The Summary section has a Preview of the text. If the user selected tab or comma-delimited format, the Preview may look odd on the screen because it isn't in a pretty table format. Many of the data objects already have a pretty table formatted for viewing on the screen without a way to download the table. This module fills in some of the gaps in the [KBase] system. The apps in this module may gradually become obsolete as other apps and downloaders become available.

The Links and Files sections provide links for viewing the output in a new browser window (Links) or for downloading the output (Files).
