            The Multiple Sequence Alignment to be used by the app
description : |
    <p>This intended purpose of this app is to produce a downloadable <b>TEXT</b> file about an object.</p>
    
    <p>Most KBase data objects already have some type of pretty HTML table,
    either as output from an app or by dragging the object onto the narrative.
    This app serves a different purpose. This app creates one or more files that
    are downloadable and used with local tools such as Excel or computer scripts.
    </p>
     
    <p>This app creates a file on the contents of a Multiple Sequence Alignment.
    A Summary section has a preview of the output. It is intended to be a preview of the downloadable file. If the file is tab or comma delimited, it may appear misaligned on the screen but readable by a computer script. The HTML link opens a new tab with the full output. The link for downloading the files is in the Files section of the output.</p>
    
    <p>The inputs are:
    <ul>
        <li>The KBase Multiple Sequence Alignment object (output from several app)</li>

    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>The output consists of 4 columns:
    <ol>
        <li>The Multiple Sequence Alignment object</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
