    <p>This intended purpose of this app is to produce a downloadable <b>TEXT</b> report about an object.</p>
    
    <p>Most KBase data objects already have some type of pretty HTML table,
    either as output from an app or by dragging the object onto the narrative.
    This app serves a different purpose. This app creates one or more files that
    are downloadable and used with local tools such as Excel or computer scripts.
    </p>
     
    <p>This app creates a report on the contents of a FeatureSet or a SequenceSet.
    Short reports will display as TEXT in the Summary section of the output.
    Longer reports will instead have a link to open the TEXT in a new html browser tab.
    In the Files section of the output will be a link for downloading the files. 
    Whether short or long, the Summary/Link section is intended to be a preview
    of the downloadable file. If the report is tab or comma delimited, it may be
    misaligned on the screen but readable by a computer script.</p>
    
    <p>The inputs are:
    <ul>
        <li>The KBase FeatureSet or SequenceSet object (output from several app)</li>
        <li>A download option:
        <ul>
            <li>Tab-delimited. A report with tab-delimited columns.</li>
            <li>Comma-delimited. A report with comma-delimited columns.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>The output:
    <ol>
        <li>The output depends on the input feature set or sequence set. In general, sequence sets
        will be a fasta file and feature sets will be a listing of the references to the features
        in the set. For example 'BW244_0025	27092/5/1' is the feature 'BW244_0025' and it
        can be found in narrative 27092 in the object with the ID of '27092/5/1'.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
