description : |
    <p>This intended purpose of this App is to produce a downloadable <b>TEXT</b> file about an object.</p>

    <p>Most KBase data objects already have some type of viewable HTML table, either as output from an App or by dragging the object onto the Narrative. This App serves a different purpose. This App creates data files that are downloadable and used with local tools such as Excel or informatic scripts.</p>

    <p>This App creates files on the contents of a GenomeComparison object. A Summary section has a preview of the full output. It is intended to be a preview of the downloadable file. If the file is tab or comma delimited, it may appear misaligned on the screen but readable by a computer script. The HTML link opens a new tab with the full output. The link for downloading the files is in the Files section of the output. </p>

    <p>The inputs are:
    <ul>
      <li>The KBase Genome Comparison object (uploaded or output from an app)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The outputs are:
    <ol>
      <li>A <b>Link</b> section with a link to the requested file that can be opened in another browser tab.</li>
      <li>Two downloadable files in the <b>Files</b> section. One for tab-delimited and one for comma-delimited. The files have the following sections:
        <ol>
          <li>An Overview Section</li>
          <li>A List of the Genomes in the Comparison</li>
          <li>A list of the Families in the Comparison</li>
          <li>A list of the Genes and Genomes in each Family</li>
          <li>A list of the Functions in the Comparison</li>
          <li>A list of the Genes and Genomes in each Function</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
