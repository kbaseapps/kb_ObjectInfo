    <p>This intended purpose of this app is to produce a downloadable <b>TEXT</b> file about an object.</p>
    
    <p>Most KBase data objects already have some type of pretty HTML table,
    either as output from an app or by dragging the object onto the narrative.
    This app serves a different purpose. This app creates one or more files that
    are downloadable and used with local tools such as Excel or computer scripts.
    </p>
     
    <p>This app creates a file on the contents of an AssemblySet.
    A Summary section has a preview of the full output. It is intended to be a preview of the downloadable file. If the file is tab or comma delimited, it may appear misaligned on the screen but readable by a computer script. The HTML link opens a new tab with the full output. The link for downloading the files is in the Files section of the output.</p>
    
    <p>The inputs are:
    <ul>
        <li>The KBase AssemblySet object</li>
      <li>A checkbox for whether or not to include the FASTA of the Assembly objects</li>

    </ul>
    </p>
