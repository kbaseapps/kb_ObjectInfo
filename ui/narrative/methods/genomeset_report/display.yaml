    <p>This intended purpose of this App is to produce a downloadable <b>TEXT</b> file about a GenomeSet object.</p>

    <p>Most KBase data objects already have some type of viewable HTML table, either as output from an App or by dragging the object onto the Narrative. This App serves a different purpose. It creates data files that are downloadable and used with local tools such as Excel or informatic scripts.</p>

    <p>This App creates files on the Genomes in a GenomeSet. A Summary section has a preview of the full output. It is intended to be a preview of the downloadable file. If the file is tab or comma delimited, it may appear misaligned on the screen but readable by a computer script. The HTML link opens a new tab with the full output. The link for downloading the files is in the Files section of the output. </p>

    <p><b>Inputs:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The KBase GenomeSet object.</li>
      <li>A download option:
        <ul>
          <li>A list of genomes. Both tab-delimited and comma-delimited will be created.</li>
          <li>DNA Fasta. A file with the DNA FASTA of each of the Genomes. NOTE: this is really long.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p><b>Output:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>The <b>Summary</b> or <b>Link</b> section has a text version of the requested file.</li>
      <li>One or more downloadable files in the <b>Files</b> section. The name and content of the file will depend on the requested file format.
        <ol>
          <li>The list of genomes in tab-delimited (.tsv) and comma-delimited (.csv) format.</li>
          <li>FASTA files will be in FASTA format. The file name will end in .fna for nucleotide files and .faa for amino acid files.</li>
          <li>The other files contain summary statistics about the genomes in the set. The differences are just in the format of the information.</li>
        </ol></li>
    </ol>
