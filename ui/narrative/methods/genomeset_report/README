List of things I need to do to make these official:

1. CHECK: Give better description of the output options in the display.yaml
2. CHECK: Get better test objects instead of pointing to things in my narratives
3. CHECK: Decide if DataTableJS should be used in the html versions
4. CHECK: Why am I creating the HTML version? Is it the alternative viewing option when the output is long?
5. Someday switch over to the official way to do GFF
6. Keep an eye on genome object changes coming
7. How can I do multiple formats at the same time?
8. Better report names based on user input
9. Should display.yml make it clear that these are not offical KBase apps? Can't call them 3rd-party but they aren't blessed either.
10. There should be space-delimited version as well
11. Will I support other features in the genome tab-delimited report
